For our project, The Support Corner – Logo and Banner, we aimed to create a cohesive visual identity that reflects the supportive and approachable nature of the brand.

Our design process focused on developing a logo that embodies the essence of community and assistance, while the banner complements this with a welcoming and professional aesthetic. By incorporating thoughtful color schemes and modern design elements, we ensured that both the logo and banner are not only visually appealing but also resonate with the brand’s mission of providing guidance and support.
