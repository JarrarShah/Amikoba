At Urban Relish Restaurant, we had the privilege of crafting a comprehensive brand identity that captures the vibrant spirit of urban dining. Our work encompassed the creation of a dynamic logo, a visually engaging menu, and eye-catching signage that seamlessly integrates with the restaurant’s modern aesthetic.

We extended the brand’s reach through thoughtfully designed staff clothing that enhances the overall experience, and a striking van wrap that brings the Urban Relish brand to the streets, ensuring a cohesive and memorable presence across all touchpoints.
