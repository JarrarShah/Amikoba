The coffee hut brings the smart coffee experience to every professional who loves a bit of bougie in their hustle. Established in the capital city of Abuja, it communicates warmth on a busy cold morning and calm on a chaotic night-out.

Hand-brewed from scratch, our blend of exotic coffee with the chill of the perfect lounge to conduct businesses, this experience is sure to leave you wanting more. Our office spaces are available for meetings you don’t have to rush to work for and meetings to remotely seal those deals.

We take pride in delivering the best service and have taken time to ensure the health and safety of our customers. The world and life itself is evolving why shouldn’t your coffee experience?

Through this, we aim to bring back the fun in bougie, one mug at a time.
